            Essaimage Associates has been training and mentoring field-based personnel since 1982. Professional selling is a difficult career, and when combined with always being on the move, represents a formidable challenge!<br>
            Robert Owen wrote his first "Basic Field Sales Engineer Training" in 1984 and has given this course many times. It is aimed at the new recruit who has just started in the field, and is struggling to get organised whilst trying to satisfy the growing demands of his customers and his boss. They find that there is never enough time, and they always seem to be in the wrong place when difficult requests come. This "Working Remotely" course enables a Professional Sales person to tap into 30 years of experience and make a step-function improvement in their productivity! It includes sections on Personal Organisation, Travel, Home Office, Time Management, Understanding your Customers' needs, Building you Support Network, Note Taking and Communications.<br>
            Other training topics which have also been given as formal training include: Interviewing Skills, The One Minute ManagerÂ®, Creative Brainstorming/Mind Mapping, Professional Selling, and Stress Management.<br>
            Of great relevance in today's global markets is Cultural Awareness. Most professional people spend time in meetings with people from different countries, and this creates many issues. The way you use English, your mannerisms, and the way you interact with others, can all create hidden problems preventing business success. Even sitting in the wrong place can be offensive! Training in this area is vital to enable self-awareness - once you know these details are important, you can respect them.<br>
            Robert Owen has given this kind of training as formal courses, as well as "on the job". It can work very well when developing customer-facing personnel, to enable them to have ad-hoc access to Robert's expertise as and when they need it. Then his wisdom helps the person at the time they most need it: just before a major trip or an important meeting.<br>
