            Engineering and Technology courses need access to new technologies and help to put them to good use. Most Universities do not have the funds to keep the hands-on content of their courses at the leading edge, but to attract the best students and create the best talent, they need to find a way to regularly update their Labs. This provides an opportunity for technology companies to create future demand for their products by ensuring that every engineering student graduates with an instinctive preference to use and design with their products. By capturing student mindshare early, it is possible to create long-term sustained growth in market share.<br>
            This approach works best for technologies which are "sticky", those where their use requires investment of time and effort to understand. This builds a deeply-rooted barrier to switching to products from others.<br>
            Examples include Microsoft's Office, National Instruments' LabView, and Texas Instruments with DSP (Digital Signal Processing). In the semiconductor business, Motorola (now Freescale) were hugely successful doing this with their Microcontrollers (MCUs) in the 1990s, a space now occupied by Microchip. Essaimage Associates are probably the world leader in how to do this.<br>
            Essaimage Associates have the unique and precious know-how to do this, and to do it better than anyone else.
