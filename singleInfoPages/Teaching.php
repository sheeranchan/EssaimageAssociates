            Essaimage Associates has a unique record in the creation of Teaching Materials for Academic use. These are materials which enable a Lecturer to take a new technology and quickly build a series of Lab exercises around this technology, making it much more likely that a University will make effective use of the new technology. The key skills involved here, are the massive network required to yield suitable Academic Authors, definition and licensing of the contents, management of the development process, and thorough debug/proofing of the materials.<br>
            The first project in 1995 was a DSP Teaching Kit written by the University of Hertfordshire (UK) which provided everything a Lecturer needed to run 5 different Labs on the basics of Digital Signal Processing. Over 4000 kits were sold at $199 each within two years! After two successful versions, this concept evolved into the free-of-charge "Teaching ROM" containing slides, course notes, back-up material, references and demo programs.<br>
            Teaching ROMs were produced for Texas Instruments' C2000 Digital Signal Controller (3 editions), C5000 low-power DSP (2 editions), C6000/OMAP-L138 DSP (3 editions), MSP430 low-power microcontrollers (2 editions) and Stellaris ARM Cortex M3 Microcontrollers (first edition).</p><br>

            Essaimage Associates have also facilitated the publication and dissemination of many different materials developed by Universities teaching these technologies, using a simple non-exclusive license agreement with the Universities. This is win-win for both University and Manufacturer.<br>
            A significant new addition was made in 2011, when a Teaching Kit for Analog Electronics was produced in collaboration with Texas Instruments India and MikroElektronika in Belgrade:<br>
            "The Analog Systems Lab Kit, Pro"</p><br>
