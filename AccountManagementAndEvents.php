            are all words that often prefix "customer". But what do they mean?<br>
            And is there a difference between "customer" and "client"?<br>

            These are concerns faced by every company as they decide how best to serve their existing and future customers. Furthermore, there are other issues that flow from this:<br>

            How best to incentivise or reward sales people?<br>
            How to track the business accurately and capture the vital trends?<br>
            How to report prospecting and opportunities succinctly to management?<br>
            When to replace sales people?<br>
            How to work with distributors?<br>
            Essaimage Associates has long experience in this area, reflected in the seminal course written for Texas Instruments called "Best Practices in Account Management (BPAM)".<br>

            Essaimage Associates has built a long-running series of Academic Conferences around the theme of Signal Processing. "EDERC" - the European DSP Education and Research Conference - a two day event, started in Paris in 1996 and ran successfully in 1998 and 2000, then again in Nice in 2010. A one-day version "EDERS" - European DSP Education and Research Symposium ran in 2004 (Birmingham), 2006 (Munich) and 2008 (Tel Aviv). The company also prepared for EDERC 2012 in Amsterdam. Blending commercial priorities with the needs of an academic audience is a difficult balance, but one that was achieved brilliantly, even gaining the endorsements of both the IEEE and EURASIP.<br>

            The company's wide knowledge of cities and universities, means that good venues can be identified almost anywhere. We also have the experience to supervise the design of booths and the expertise to run them well. Examples include the IEEE events "ICASSP" - International Conference in Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing: 1997 Munich, 2000 Istanbul, 2006 Toulouse, and 2011 Prague. Examples of harnessing Universities as venues for training Lecturers and Researchers were the running of DSP (Digital Signal Procesing) and Microcontroller courses across the region: Glasgow, Bristol, Paris, Florence, Madrid, Gothenburg, Tampere, Istanbul, Ankara, Bilkent, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Niederrhein, Landshut, Warsaw and Prague.<br>
