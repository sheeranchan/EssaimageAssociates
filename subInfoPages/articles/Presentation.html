            In parallel with his career in the electronics industry, Robert "Robbie" Owen is an accomplished radio presenter. So it is not surprising that his roles in Sales and Marketing are characterised by excellent communications whether to individuals or in presentations to large groups.<br>
            He started his radio career in 1974 with hospital radio at Radio Hertford, then became a true "pirate" presenting Top 40 on the offshore radio station "The Voice of Peace" off the coast of Israel in 1978 (referred to on-air as being "somewhere in the Mediterranean"). His association with the Voice of Peace lived on many years after his last visit in 1982, as his voce introduced and closed the nightly "Twilight Time" programme. At Christmas in 1990, he completed a freelance contract with the Austrian State Broadcaster the ORF, on Blue Danube Radio in Vienna, where he presented "Good Morning Austria" and the Midday Magazine programmes. The music was "soft AC" (Adult Contemporary), with a high speech content of news and interviews.<br>
            In September 1990 he joined the newly established KCBC, a "golden oldies" station in Kettering, and progressed to be their Programme Controller in 1993-94, whilst still working full-time at Texas Instruments Bedford. In 1993, 1995 and 1997 he also completed working holidays at KOKO (Adult Contemporary & Local News format), the local commercial radio station established in 1952 to serve Warrensburg, Missouri, USA (near Kansas City). This gave him inside experience of how American local commercial radio really operates!<br>
            At KCBC he developed a show for aficionados of the 60's "beat boom" , which was later called the "Jukebox Drive-In". This programme aired weekly on the High Wycombe station elevenSEVENTY from 1995 to 2000, and from March 2001 the Jukebox Drive-In moved to hertbeat fm where it aired weekly until May 2010. The programme regularly included interviews with luminaries from the music world<br>
            In May 2010, after hertbeat fm became Jack fm (and now BOB fm), the Jukebox Drive-In moved to community radio station Biggles FM in Potton, Bedfordshire until July 2012. Then in October 2016, after a long break, it returned to Northamptonshire on the new community radio station NLive, where Robbie is a founding member. The programme can be heard each Sunday at 7pm (nliveradio.com).<br>
