            Essaimage Associates is a lean and resourceful business, able to find efficient and durable ways to solve major problems. This experience did not come through more than 30 years of association with a corporation like Texas Instruments, but through building a new radio station from scratch!<br>
            So how do you build a new radio station? The hertbeat fm story is one that few have experienced. Many people dream of running their own radio station, but few actually make that dream reality because it is a long and complex process requiring many skills that just are not within the grasp of a typical "radio presenter".<br>
            In the case of hertbeat fm, the first step was the forming of an effective group to secretly lobby the Radio Authority for a licence to be offered in their area. This required political acumen as well as strong motivation. Once the licence was finally advertised, the group went public and set about generating massive local support, to counteract the emerging challenge from one of the most powerful newspaper groups in the UK. The licence application required credible answers to several fundamental criteria:<br>

                <tr><td>Proof that you had strong support and most of your management already in place</td></tr>
                <tr><td>That your Programming would cater for local tastes and interests, as well as being commercially viable</td></tr>
                <tr><td>That you had done detailed Market Research so you could genuinely demonstrate what the local audience wanted to hear</td></tr>
                <tr><td>That you had sufficient financial backing (circa Â£500,000) and a detailed business plan from start-up and up to 8 years on-air!</td></tr>
                <tr><td>AND, that you understood the Engineering challenges of the both the transmission sites and the studio location</td></tr>

            The hertbeat fm Licence Application was a convincing winner, causing immense embarrassment to the so called "experts" who had rubbished the efforts of this independent group!<br>
            Robbie and his team then built the radio station and it went on-air on March 3rd 2001. He was the Executive Vice-Chairman for 5 years, until July 2005 when the business was sold.<br>
            This project demonstrates an incredibly diverse range of skills: people selection, press & public relations, lobbying, market research, capital raising, financial planning, buildings, transmission sites, studios, marketing, promotions, sales, music, programming, presenter & sales training, cash-flow management, due diligence, trade sale, contracts, and shareholder relations.<br>
