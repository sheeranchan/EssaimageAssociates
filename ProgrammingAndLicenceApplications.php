            Robbie has long experience of matching programmes to audiences, and successfully passing Radio Authority/OFCOM assessments. He prepared the programming sections of KCBC's relicensing in 1994, and was the primary author of hertbeat's successful application in 2000. He also played a leading role in the "Maid FM" application for the Maidstone license, which was the runner-up.<br>
            The disciplines required to succeed in these application processes are extremely demanding, and the success of the hertbeat fm application against formidable opposition was a decisive demonstration of Robbie's creative, organisational, and analytical skills.<br>
