After 13months under Robert's guidance and leadership, I had experienced more than any of my University counterparts in similar internships. Robert invests his time, knowledge and experience. You are never made to feel like any question is too simple or stupid. As a manager he challenges you to challenge yourself and instils a strong working ethic at the same time as offering his constant guidance and support. Robert provided me with a great starting point to my career. Thank you Robert!</blockquote>
