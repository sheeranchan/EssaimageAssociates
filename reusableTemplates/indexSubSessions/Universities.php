                            Engineering and Technology courses need effective and convenient access to new technologies and help, to put them into good use. Most universities do not have enough resources to keep the hands-on content of their courses at the leading edge, but to attract the best students and create the best talent, they need to find a way to regularly update their Labs. This provides an opportunity for technology companies to create future demand for their products by ensuring that every engineering student graduates with an instinctive preference to use and design with their products. By capturing student mindshare early, it is possible to create long-term sustained growth in market share.<br>
                            This approach works best for technologies which are "sticky", those where their use requires investment of time and effort to understand. This builds a deeply-rooted barrier to switching to products from others.<br>
                            Examples include Microsoft's Office, National Instruments' LabView, and Texas Instruments with DSP (Digital Signal Processing). In the semiconductor business, Motorola (now Freescale) were hugely successful doing this with their Microcontrollers (MCUs) in the 1990s, a space now occupied by Microchip. Essaimage Associates are probably the world leader in how to do this.<br>
                            Essaimage Associates have the unique and precious know-how to do this, and to do it better than anyone else.<br>

                            Essaimage Associates has a unique record in the creation of Teaching Materials for Academic use. These are materials which enable a Lecturer to take a new technology and quickly build a series of Lab exercises around this technology, making it much more likely that a University will make effective use of the new technology. The key skills involved here, are the massive network required to yield suitable Academic Authors, definition and licensing of the contents, management of the development process, and thorough debug/proofing of the materials.<br>
                            The first project in 1995 was a DSP Teaching Kit written by the University of Hertfordshire (UK) which provided everything a Lecturer needed to run 5 different Labs on the basics of Digital Signal Processing. Over 4000 kits were sold at $199 each within two years! After two successful versions, this concept evolved into the free-of-charge "Teaching ROM" containing slides, course notes, back-up material, references and demo programs.<br>
                            Teaching ROMs were produced for Texas Instruments' C2000 Digital Signal Controller (3 editions), C5000 low-power DSP (2 editions), C6000/OMAP-L138 DSP (3 editions), MSP430 low-power microcontrollers (2 editions) and Stellaris ARM Cortex M3 Microcontrollers (first edition).<br>
                            A significant new addition was made in 2011, when a Teaching Kit for Analog Electronics was produced in collaboration with Texas Instruments India and MikroElektronika in Belgrade: "The Analog Systems Lab Kit, Pro"<br>
                            Essaimage Associates have also facilitated the publication and dissemination of many different materials developed by Universities teaching these technologies, using a simple non-exclusive license agreement with the Universities. This is win-win for both University and Manufacturer.<br>
                            One example is the MIPSfpga teaching materials, which came with an unobfuscated MIPS microAptiv softcore for academic use. MIPSfpga was the recipient of the 2015 Elektra award, but more importantly, won the approval of hundreds of universities all over the world. Today, the teaching package is being licenced by over 500 academics, and many from leading institutions.<br>

                            External Support: As the teaching materials become popular, there will be an increasing need to have an effective support team. Essaimage Associates have been honing our unique expertise in bringing together an experienced and dynamic support team to help our customers delivery quality teaching materials and help. Our support teams have also helped organise and present at global events and workshops.<br>
                            Internal Support: Academia is a boiling pot of ideas! Amongst this mass of exploration are innovations that could give your business a competitive advantage. But finding these "nuggets" of IP (Intellectual Property) is a daunting task, and there is always the nagging doubt that your competitors might get there first.<br>
                            Essaimage Associates has a well-structured process that can facilitate the identification of key new technologies and then map them to specific Universities and groups. Once identified, we can advise on the best way to engage with those researchers so both Company and University are successful.<br>
