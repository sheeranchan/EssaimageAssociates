            Europe's young people have endured prolonged criticism in the Press. They are often told that "standards are falling" or "they are not as good as they were", and politicians reorganise Europe's Higher Education systems almost continuously.<br>
            Our opinion is that our expectations are now higher than ever before, and that is why we perceive standards as falling. This problem is compounded because everyone is now under much greater pressure to deliver, and this has squeezed out those precious few minutes of advice that young people used to get regularly from their wise elders. Instead they are now expected to "go figure it out for themselves". In today's busy "always ON" world, it is crazy to ignore the huge wealth of raw talent that is flowing through Higher Education every year.<br>
            Essaimage Associates has worked with more than 50 one-year placement students since 1994. By taking care to recruit those with the right attitude (note the word attitude, not skills) and then prioritising the right training, a steady stream of truly outstanding Electronic Engineers and Marketing/Business Graduates has been produced.<br>
            Essaimage Associates took the French model of *Stagiaires, and grew this into a self-sustaining process which produces outstanding people. Almost all of these Students made a major contribution to their hosts, and a year later after graduating, most them returned as full-time employees.<br>
            [*Stagiaire: Students on 1 year professional placements, which are a required part of their course, and which are supported and assessed by the University]<br>
            Successful businesses need energetic and creative people. This "stagiaire process" provides a very cost-effective way to supply this need. It is a delight to see the amazed looks of colleagues as an effective Student Intern begins to take initiative and contributes strongly to a company. In our experience, they consistently out-perform new graduates who did not do a placement!<br>
            Essaimage Associates can show you how to set-up this process, kick-off the recruitment, supervise the selection, then guide and mentor the first wave of Students through their year with you to ensure success. Once the process enters its second year it becomes self-supporting.
            One final thought: this programme works well in small companies. It is not something just for large organisations, in fact large companies often have low expectations of their students and fail to unlock their potential.<br>
