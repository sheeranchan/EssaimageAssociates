            Placing a company's technologies into Engineering courses creates productive long-term partnerships with Lecturers and Professors. These relationships enable really effective recruiting, whether for Student Placements (Internships) or Graduates. Often the Lecturers themselves will highlight the best candidates because they want to sustain the relationship with your company. Essaimage Associates has visited more than 500 of the 1200 Technical Universities and Colleges in Europe and has personal links to circa 2,500 post-graduates in Teaching and Research. Our unique "stagiaire" approach to one year professional placements for bright Engineering, Marketing and Business students provides exceptionally talented people in your company for a year, with the possibility of recruiting them full-time a year later.<br>
            Academia is a boiling pot of ideas! Amongst this mass of exploration are innovations that could give your business a competitive advantage. But finding these "nuggets" of IP (Intellectual Property) is a daunting task, and there is always the nagging doubt that your competitors might get there first. Essaimage Associates has a well-structured process that can facilitate the identification of key new technologies and then map them to specific Universities and groups. Once identified, we can advise on the best way to engage with those researchers so both Company and University are successful.
